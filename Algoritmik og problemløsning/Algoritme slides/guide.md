##Making the presentation
The slides are in beamer, it is called presentation.pdf.
This presentation can optimally be made in 1,5-2 hours.
The students do not need to have knowledge of algorithms in advance, but it will
make the exercises a lot more fun for you and them.

##Making changes to the slides
To make changes, work in the presentation.tex. 
Images to be included should be in beamer/include.
Compile using "pdflatex *tex-filename*".

The slides are compiled from the slides made by Arinbj√∏rn Brandsson, Benjamin 
Rotendahl, Mathias Fleig Mortensen and Christopher Mulvad Groot, with minor
fixes.
